# SimpleClosure Take Home Test

## Running Locally

```
$ git clone https://github.com/brandondurham/simple-closure.git
$ cd simple-closure
$ npm i
$ npm run start

This will start an Express server (which is used as a simple api for retrieving LinkedIn profile information)
and a client-side React application, available at `http://localhost:5173/`.
